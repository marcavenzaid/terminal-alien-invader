# Terminal Alien Invader
Inspired by the Alien Invader game.

I made this back in 2014 (I think), and it is one of the first programming projects I created.

I used the conio.h library in the original code. When I revisited this old project in 2024, I found that conio.h is already deprecated. I tried using alternative libraries to make it work, which they did, but thereâ€™s a bug where the ship suddenly stops functioning after a while.
